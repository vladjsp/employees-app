### Description

<p>A complicated version of the "todo" task with search and filtering.</p>
<p>The task was as follows: to transfer the old project from class components to functional ones. Then switch to using the state manager (Redux Toolkit) and at the end migrate the entire project to use Typescript instead of Javascript.</p>

### Tech stack:

```
- JS --> TS
- ReactJS
- Redux Toolkit
- SASS
```
